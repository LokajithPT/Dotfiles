# How to Install Flutter and Android SDK on Arch Linux (for Future Gemini)

This guide assumes a fresh Arch Linux installation. Follow these steps to set up a working Flutter environment.

## 1. Prerequisites

Install necessary packages. Java 17 is recommended for Android command-line tools.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm git unzip jdk17-openjdk wget
```

## 2. Install Flutter

Clone the stable branch of Flutter. We'll put it in `~/tools`, but you can choose another location.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tools
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable ~/tools/flutter
```

## 3. Install Android Command Line Tools

Flutter needs the Android SDK. We'll start with the command-line tools.

1.  Create the directory structure:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools
    ```

2.  Download the latest command-line tools (check for the newest URL if this fails):
    ```bash
    cd ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools
    wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-11076708_latest.zip -O tools.zip
    unzip -q tools.zip
    # Important: The tools must be inside a folder named 'latest'
    mv cmdline-tools latest
    rm tools.zip
    ```

## 4. Configure Shell Environment (.zshrc)

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` (or `.bashrc`). This sets up the paths for Flutter, Android SDK, and Java.

```bash
# Java
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Android SDK
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Flutter
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/tools/flutter/bin

# Chrome (Use Brave/Chrome as the web executable)
# Uncomment the one you have installed:
export CHROME_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/brave
# export CHROME_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
```

**Apply changes:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## 5. Configure Flutter and Android SDK

1.  Tell Flutter where the Android SDK and JDK are:
    ```bash
    flutter config --android-sdk $HOME/Android/Sdk
    flutter config --jdk-dir /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
    ```

2.  Accept Android Licenses (this requires the correct Java version):
    ```bash
    yes | flutter doctor --android-licenses
    ```

## 6. Verify Installation

Run `flutter doctor` to ensure everything is green.

```bash
flutter doctor
```

## 7. Connect a Device

1.  Enable **Developer Options** and **USB Debugging** on your Android phone.
2.  Connect via USB.
3.  Run `adb devices` or `flutter devices` to verify connection.
